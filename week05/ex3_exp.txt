As we can see in our "ex3_exp.txt", the time that process spend in user mode is greater than real execution time. 
This fact tells us that the process of finding the number of primes on certain range is CPU bound.
So, someone can take the advantage if he parallelizes this process.

However, between the moments when n=10 and n=100 the difference between real time is not significant.
This may tell us that, probably, number of threads is reaching number of physical threads.
So the performance gain become negligible.
