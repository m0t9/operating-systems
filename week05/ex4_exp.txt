As we can see, for large M (10, 100) the execution time in the previous exercise is less than in current one.
Threads work independently only when they perform prime check, and "stuck" when they're waiting for mutex acquisition.
We figure it out looking at the sys time (time that process spent in kernel).

For the larger amount of threads the performance gain will be small.
Again, increasing the number of threads gives advantage when they work independently.
Their amount also should not exceed the number of physical threads to increase computational speed.
