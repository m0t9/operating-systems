If we make the value of macro TRI_BASE less, like 100, we will obtain a number to start checking for "triangularity" that less than 100.
When we run this program, we obtain much more triangular numbers in comparison to TRI_BASE 1000000.
It means, that amount of triangular numbers is greater for the intervals that closer to zero.

When we change the Arrival Time for all processes to 0, the scheduler takes processes in order as they appear in the provided data file.
