The output differs in the manner how Round-Robin scheduling works. 
Processes are being added to queue when they are newcommers or stopped. The scheduler takes first from queue for execution.
Performance also depends on the size of quant. If it is big - the system is not so responsible.
If it is small - too frequent context switches negatively affect on performance.
With quant equal to 3 seconds, average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time are greater than in ex2 and ex3.
