After moving the file "myfile1.txt" to "/tmp" directory modification event for "myfile11.txt" was not reported by monitor process.
Looks like, the inotify looks only for updates for initial file. Now the initial file not in the watched directory.

After symbolic link creation, the update of the "tmp/myfile1.txt" did not anyhow affect the symbolic link update in watched directory.
I suppose, the inotify reports only events that affect hardlinks.

Because of "unlink_all" function removes only in the watched directory, it can not anyhow visit non-child directory.
So, the hardlink in "/tmp" will be untouched, the number of hardlinks will be 2.
