After moving the file "myfile1.txt" to "/tmp" directory modification event for "myfile11.txt" was not reported by monitor process.
Due to the note from man7 page of inotify "events are not generated for the files inside the directory when the events are
performed via a pathname that lies outside the monitored directory". This is exactly the case of file movement.

After symbolic link creation, the update of the "tmp/myfile1.txt" did not anyhow affect the symbolic link update in watched directory.
This case is like the previous one - the update came from the directory that is not monitored by inotify.

Because of "unlink_all" function removes only in the watched directory, it can not anyhow visit non-child directory.
So, the hardlink in "/tmp" will be untouched, the number of hardlinks will stay 2. One in watched directory, one - in tmp.
