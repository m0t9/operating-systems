If I run compiled ex3.c with 10MB MEMORY_SIZE parameter, then I won't observe any updates in si (swap in) and so (swap out) in vmstat.
However, if I run it with 1GB, then the swap out memory size grows.
It means, that at certain moment there is no enough main memory and allocated memory is being moved to the hard drive.
