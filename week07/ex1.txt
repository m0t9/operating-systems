Testing results are:
Throughput for First-Fit allocation algorithm is 72.947639 ops/sec
Throughput for Best-Fit allocation algorithm is 47.273212 ops/sec
Throughput for Worst-Fit allocation algorithm is 47.885418 ops/sec

As we can see, First-Fit allocation algorithm on the queries.txt file is significantly faster than other ones.
Along with that, Best-Fit and Worst-Fit demonstrate almost equal performance.
