Running provided input example, we can find out that Random replacement algorithm has the biggest number of Disk accesses.
NFU is better than Random one, but worse than Aging algorithm.

However, when I was testing on my self-generated tests, Random page replacement algorithm was sometimes better than NFU.
And it could be true, because of that this algorithm "remembers everything".
