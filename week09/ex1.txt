Running provided input example, we can find out that Random replacement algorithm has the biggest number of Disk accesses.
Therefore it has less hit ratio.
NFU is better than Random one, but worse than Aging algorithm. 
Hit ratio with Aging algorithm is the biggest one, buf insignificantly.

However, when I was testing on my self-generated tests, Random page replacement algorithm was sometimes better than NFU.
And it could be true, because of that this algorithm "remembers everything".
