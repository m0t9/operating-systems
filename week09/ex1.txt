Running provided input example, we can find out that Random replacement algorithm has the biggest number of Disk accesses.
Therefore it has less hit ratio.
NFU is better than random algorithm, and the aging algorithm has the same disk accesses count as NFU one on provided test.
However, on my self generated tests aging algorithm was slightly better than NFU.

Also, when I was testing on my self-generated tests, Random page replacement algorithm was sometimes better than NFU.
And it could be true, because of that this algorithm "remembers everything".
