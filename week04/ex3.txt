RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT WITH N = 3

Intially we have only one process, that on the first loop iteration created a child process. 
After each 5 seconds (due to the command "sleep") every process was creating a child one.
Therefore, after first iteration we have 2 processes. On the second each of them create a new one.
Then we have 4 processes, and after 3rd iteration we have 8 processes. 
The total execution time for this case is 15 seconds.

RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT WITH N = 5

Ideologically, for N = 5 the observation is the same. After each 5 seconds every process was creating a new one.
But it was done 5 times instead of 3, therefore on the final pstree call we can observe 32 "ex3" processes.
The total execution time, obviously, was increased to 25 seconds.

Results of these calls represent the same "process" of forking.
But for the second case (N = 5) we have 24 more processes and 10 seconds longer runtime.
